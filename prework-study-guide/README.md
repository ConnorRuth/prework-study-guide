# prework-study-guide

## Description

This Prework Study guide was created for boot camp students who were going through prework. It consists of CSS, HTML, and JS files for those at the learning stages with these languages. In this way acts as an introductory method of learn by doing with these languages. It has helped being able to go back and see what I'm learning and in the future look back and see the starting point.During this project, I've learned how to implement previous knowledge in new ways in relation to CSS. HTML and JavaScript have been great for understanding syntax, elements, variables, and funtions, and computer read order. Contains notes on these that may be further expanded on
